# Data cleaning and pre-processing

Data cleaning is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in a raw format that is (usually) not ideal for the analysis.

In a typical machine learning project, data cleaning and preprocessing is responsible for **80% of the work.**
Thus, it is of the utmost importance that you know how to do it (and do it well).

Data cleaning and preprocessing depend completely on the data type, so we'll have the following sections:

- [Structured data cleaning](1.cleaning.ipynb)
- [Structured data preprocessing](2.preprocessing.ipynb)

The following list will gather common libraries used for data manipulation:

- [`pandas-profiling` - Awesome dataframe profiling tool](https://pypi.org/project/pandas-profiling/)
- [`scikit-learn` - Structured data cleaning and preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [`pandas` - Structured data cleaning and preprocessing](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [`scikit-image` - Image data cleaning and preprocessing](https://scikit-image.org/)
- [`opencv` - Computer vision library](https://opencv.org/)
