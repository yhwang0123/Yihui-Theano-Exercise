- Type of challenge: **Learning**
- Duration: **30 min**
- Team challenge: **solo**

## Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to:

- move around the file system
- list the content of a directory
- get your position in the file system

## Requirements

This briefing assumes that you know how to:

- consult the manual within the terminal

## The mission

You’ve heard of three new commands to explore the file-system `cd` , `ls` (![Windows icon](./assets/win_icon.png) `dir`) and `pwd` (![Windows icon](./assets/win_icon.png) `cd` with no arguments). Open your **terminal** and **read
their manuals** to understand them, then follow the instructions below.

- Print your location on the screen.
- Print the content of your current directory.
- Print the content of `/` (![Windows icon](./assets/win_icon.png) `C:\` probably (or another drive letter)).
- Move to the folder `/bin` (![Windows icon](./assets/win_icon.png) `C:\Windows\System32` or `C:\Program Files` (or another drive letter))
- Print your new location.
- Go back to your home folder.

### Optional

Ever wished you could teleport? Well, check out `pushd` and `popd` to get amazing warping power.

- Move to any location on your file system for a quick job.
- Pop back to your previous location to get back to work.

## Congrats

You can now sail across your system. If you’re brave enough, learn more about the Linux/Windows file system and understand what the purpose of the folders in `/` (or ![Windows icon](./assets/win_icon.png) `C:\`) is.
