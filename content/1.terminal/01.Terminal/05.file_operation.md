- Type of challenge: **Learning**
- Duration: **60 min**
- Team challenge: **solo**

## Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to:

- read a file
- create a file
- create a folder
- move a file
- copy a file
- rename a file
- delete a file
- delete a folder

## Requirements

This briefing assumes that you know how to:

- consult the manual within the terminal

## The mission

You’ve heard of a bunch of new commands to work with files `cat`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm` and `rmdir`. Open
your **terminal** and **read their manuals** to understand them, then follow the instructions below.

- Create a file named `one.txt`.
- Type `echo "Hello World" > one.txt` to write some text into the file.
- Print the content of that file on the screen.
- Create a folder named `story`.
- Move `one.txt` into that folder.
- Copy `one.txt` inside the folder `story` as `two.txt`.
- Print the content of both files.
- Rename `one.txt` to `part_one.txt` and `two.txt` to `part_two.txt`.
- Type `echo "I am a junior at BeCode." > story/part_two.txt` to write some text into the file.
- Print the content of both files simultaneously.
- Remove the folder `story` and all its content.

There are two ways to remove a folder, try to find both.

## Congrats

You are now able to manage all your files and folders in the command line. Although it might not be obvious, **the terminal is a very powerful and modern environment** which will save you lots of time if you’re willing to learn how to
use it.
