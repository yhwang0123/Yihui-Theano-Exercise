# Discover the Terminal

Time to discover the terminal and work with the most common commands.

## Goals

You should be able to use the right terminal syntax:

- Move around the file system;
- Show the contents of a folder;
- Create a folder
- Create a file
- Change a filename
- Remove a file

As you'll see, the exercises below give you the objective, but not how to do them. When you don't know, it's time to ask your new BFF: Google! That's one core rule at BeCode : before asking your neighbor for help, ask the internet!

ETA: 3 hours

## The Drill

**All the exercises that follow can only be executed through the terminal !**

To practice, open a Terminal window. Then ...

- Go to your Desktop folder.
- Check to see if you are in the Desktop folder by printing the current directory name.
- Create a file `text.txt`.
- Open the file in an editor inside the Terminal and write a line of text (the first sentence that comes to mind) and save the file.
- Make a folder called `Octocat`.
- Go to your new `Octocat` folder.
- Once in your new directory, create the file `yolo.md` in there.
- Open the file and enter your name in it, then save and close it.
- Make a second file, in the same directory, called `README.md`.
- Write a small paragraph of text about some of the projects you want to achieve during this training.
- Make a third file in `Octocat`, named after your first and last name with the `.md` extension. In that file, write a little text explaining why you want to be a BeCode Developer.
- Remove the file `text.txt`.
- List the contents of the `Octocat` directory.
- Create a folder called `Skills` and inside it, create a file `successful.md` in which you write down your computer skills. This can be a list, either with the languages you know or the languages you want to know.
- Create the folder `becode_projects` in which you can store all your future BeCode files.
- Press the `Up Arrow` key and see what happens. You can repeat it multiple times to get the previous commands that you typed. Pretty handy, no ?
