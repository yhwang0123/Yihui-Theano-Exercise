# Pimp your terminal

## Hey, why is terminal so ugly

It shouldn't be! You will spend way more time using it thank you think.

In fact, during my previous job, some days I was spending more of my time in my terminal than in my code editor...

So it should be a safe place. A place where you like to be and to work. Clear, cool to look at and even calming.

How? Well, there are several ways of customizing your terminal!

First, you can change the colors (check in your terminal's settings).
Then, you can install additional plug-ins. (look at `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh` you will be amazed!)

Some examples:
